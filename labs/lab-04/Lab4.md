# Lab 4 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

### Why is it important to choose a license:

It is important to choose a license because otherwise people won't know what they can and cannot do with your code. If people don't know how they should treat your code, they may use it in ways you don't want them to, such as using it for commercial purpose or using it to create competition for your software. If you want to create completely free and open source software, such as software that would have MIT license, but you do not give it a license, then people may be hesitant to use it because they don't know to what extent they can use it.

### Why shouldn't you use a project that doesn't have an explicit license

Just because some code is out there doesn't mean it's open source. If you use code that doesn't explicitly have an open source license, then you could be sued or have other legal implications.

### Failure to follow the open system model

Gopher failed because they didn't follow the open system, and instead asserted too much control over their software and tried profiting off it. This made people less comfortable adopting it, and other alternatives prevailed.

### Microsoft .NET core MIT license

Microsoft probably chose the MIT license for .NET core because they want to encourage people to easily develop libraries. Also, Microsoft doesn't need to make money off .NET itself because they make money by hosting and providing support for .NET systems in Azure.
